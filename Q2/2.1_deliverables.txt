Description of the train/test split/process and the number of datapoints used for each split:

The data generation process for this project involves systematically creating all possible arithmetic 
equations for the operators "+", "-", and "/" over the moduli 113 and 97. For each operator and each modulus, 
every valid pair of operands (a, b) in the range 0 to p-1 (where p is the modulus, either 113 or 97) is considered, 
with division skipping cases where b is zero. For addition and subtraction, this results in 12,769 equations each 
for modulus 113 (113 × 113) and 9,409 equations each for modulus 97 (97 × 97), 
while division yields 12,656 equations for modulus 113 (113 × 112) and 9,312 equations for modulus 97 (97 × 96). 
The full set of equations for each operator and modulus is shuffled using a fixed random seed to ensure reproducibility. 
The shuffled data is then split into training (80%), 
validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. Specifically, for addition and subtraction, there are 10,215 training, 
1,277 validation, and 1,277 test examples for modulus 113, and 7,527 training, 941 validation, and 941 test examples for modulus 97; 
for division, there are 10,124 training, 1,266 validation, and 1,266 test examples for modulus 113, and 7,449 training, 931 validation, 
and 932 test examples for modulus 97. Each split is saved as a separate text file in the data directory, 
named according to the operator, modulus, and split (e.g., "addition_113_train.txt", "addition_97_val.txt", "division_113_test.txt").
